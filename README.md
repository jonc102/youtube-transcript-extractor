2. Look for the purple **"Get Transcript"** floating pill button in the bottom-right corner
3. Click the button
4. A modal will appear in the bottom-right corner with the transcript
   - **First time:** Button shows "Get Transcript" and extracts the transcript (with streaming AI summary)

10. Video remains playable while modal is open

### Extension Icon Method (Works Everywhere)

1. Navigate to any YouTube video
2. Click on the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar
3. Click "Extract & Copy Transcript" button
4. A modal will appear in the bottom-right corner of the YouTube page with the transcript
5. The popup will automatically close after opening the modal
6. Click the **gear icon** in the modal header to access Settings (or use the gear icon in the popup)

### Advanced Usage (AI Processing)

1. Click the **gear icon** to open Settings (available in extension popup OR modal header)
2. Select your **API Provider** (OpenAI or Claude)
3. Enter your **API Key**
   - For OpenAI: Get your key from [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - For Claude: Get your key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
4. Models will **automatically load** when you enter your API key
5. Enter your **Custom Prompt** (e.g., "Summarize the following transcript in bullet points:")
6. Select your preferred **Model**
7. Click **Save Settings**
8. Now when you extract a transcript:
   - Transcript is extracted from the video
   - Sent to the AI with your custom prompt
   - The AI summary appears in a separate "AI Summary" tab (shown first by default)
   - Both transcript and summary are displayed in the modal

## Output Format

### Basic Mode (No AI)
The transcript will be formatted with timestamps like this:
```
[0:00] First line of the transcript
[0:05] Second line of the transcript
[0:12] Third line continues here
```

### AI Mode (With Custom Prompt)
The output will be whatever your AI model generates based on your custom prompt. For example:
- Summarization: Bullet-point summary of the video
- Translation: Translated transcript in another language
- Analysis: Key insights and takeaways
- Custom formatting: Any format you specify in your prompt

## How It Works

### Basic Extraction
1. Detects when you're on a YouTube video page
2. Checks local cache first (instant if cached!)
3. If not cached: Automatically opens the transcript panel (if not already open)
4. Extracts all transcript segments with their timestamps
5. Formats them as `[timestamp] text` on each line
6. Opens a floating modal in the bottom-right corner
7. Displays the transcript in the modal with copy buttons (video remains accessible)

### AI Processing (Optional)
1. Extracts the transcript (steps 1-5 above)
2. Sends the transcript to your selected API (OpenAI or Claude)
3. Applies your custom prompt to the transcript
4. Returns the AI-processed result
5. Displays both transcript and AI summary in separate tabs
6. Both transcript and summary are cached together

### Caching System
- **10 most recent videos** are cached locally in your browser
- Cached data includes: transcript, AI summary (if processed), chat history, video title, timestamp
- Cache persists across browser sessions (doesn't expire)
- When you revisit a video, the modal opens instantly with cached data
- Oldest videos are automatically removed when the cache reaches 10 videos (LRU eviction)
- Cache is private to your browser (not synced across devices)

## Troubleshooting

### Transcript Extraction Issues

**"No transcript found"**
- The video may not have captions/subtitles enabled
- Try manually opening the transcript on YouTube first (click ⋯ below video → "Show transcript")
- Wait a moment after the page loads, then try the extension again
- Some videos may have transcripts disabled by the creator

**"Please open a YouTube video page"**
- Make sure you're on a video page (URL contains `/watch?v=`)
- The extension only works on video pages, not the homepage or other YouTube pages

**"Could not establish connection" error**
- Reload the extension: Go to `chrome://extensions/` and click the refresh icon
- Refresh the YouTube page
- Try clicking the extension button again

**Extension doesn't appear or won't load**
- Check that all files are in the `youtube-transcript-extension` folder
- Verify icon files (icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png) exist
- Try reloading the extension from `chrome://extensions/`

### AI Processing Issues

**"Failed to load models"**
- Check that your API key is correct
- Verify your API key has permissions to list/use models
- For OpenAI: Ensure your account has credits
- For Claude: Ensure your API key is active
- Click the Refresh button to retry

**"AI processing failed"**
- Check your API key is valid and not expired
- Verify you have sufficient API credits
- Check the selected model is available in your account
- If the error persists, the original transcript will be copied instead

**Models not loading automatically**
- After entering your API key, click outside the input field (blur event)
- Or click the Refresh button next to the model dropdown
- Check browser console for any error messages
